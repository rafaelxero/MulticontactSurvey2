		Recently, there is a growing interest with respect to the use of humanoid robots in activities
		involving the interaction with unstructured environments and their ability to perform more
		complex tasks.
		In order to achieve that, it is required to consider that the humanoid robot will make contact
		with this environment not only by using its feet, but by using its hands or any other point on
		its body, and to do it compliantly for its own safety and the safety of the people that it is
		expected to interact with; that is, to exhibit a multi-contact compliant behavior.
		This paper surveys the state of the art in whole-body multi-contact force control, by means
		of comparing the different technologies proposed by the robotics research	community.
